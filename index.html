                <b> Design Considerations:</b> <br>

                <b> Responsive Layout:</b> <br>
                The site should be responsive, ensuring it looks good on various devices (desktops, tablets, and

                <b> Color Scheme:</b> <br>A color scheme that reflects Amazon's branding, such as a mix of blue, white,
                and yellow, but simplified for this project. <br>
                <b>Spacing and Alignment:</b> <br> Use margins, paddings, and flexbox or grid layout techniques to
                create a clean and organized appearance. <br>
                <b>Technology Stack:</b>
                <br>

                <b>HTML:</b> For structuring the content. <br>
                <b>CSS: </b>For styling and layout, including flexbox or grid for responsive design. <br>

                <b>Outcome:</b> <br>
                A visually appealing static webpage that resembles Amazonâ€™s design and layout, providing a solid
                foundation for understanding web development basics.
